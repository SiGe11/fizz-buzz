# fizz-buzz
Sample and open source implementations of [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/shlomif/Freenode-programming-channel-FAQ/blob/master/FAQ.mdwn#what-is-fizzbuzz) in several languages,
under the permissive [MIT / Expat licence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

## What is FizzBuzz?

In short, FizzBuzz is a simple programming task, which most decent programmers are expected to be able to easily write, but, reportedly, most interviewed software development candidates cannot write it. It's a kind of [litmus test](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/litmus_test) for programmers.

For more information, see:

* [Why Canâ€™t Programmers Program?](http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/)
* [FizzBuzz on Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/FizzBuzz) (WARNING! The licence is problematic.)
* [FizzBuzz Enterprise Edition](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition)
* [FizzBuzz in every programming language](https://github.com/zenware/FizzBuzz) - under a non-specified licence.

### Description of the problem

Print the natural numbers from 1 to 100, one in each line, but if the number
is divisible by 3 print "Fizz" (without the quotes) instead and if it is
divisible by 5 print "Buzz" instead and if it is divisible by both 3 and 5,
print "FizzBuzz".
