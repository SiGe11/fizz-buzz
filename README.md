## What is FizzBuzz?

In short, FizzBuzz is a simple programming task, which most decent programmers are expected to be able to easily write, but, reportedly, most interviewed software development candidates cannot write it. It's a kind of [litmus test](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/litmus_test) for programmers.
