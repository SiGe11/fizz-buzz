# How to contribute

You want to contribute? Great! Welcome aboard. Please submit pull-requests
with sources for new languages with these guidelines:

* The code must be licenced under the [Expat licence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) or a different [permissive licence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_licence) that is compatible with it as well as with versions 2 and 3 of the [GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License).

* If your code is based on someone else's, please provide attribution and a link in a comment or inline documentation.

* The filename should be `fizz-buzz.ext` or `FizzBuzz.ext`.

* The code should emit the contents of `fizz-buzz.txt` to stdout, when run with no command line arguments, and with no warnings or errors. Note that this assumes Unix-like [line endings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline) and may vary on Windows and similar OSes.

* The code should be modular but not over-engineered.

* The code should not contain trailing whitespace.
